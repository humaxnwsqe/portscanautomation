<Port Scan Automaton Test Package>

[Ver. 1.1]
# Summary
 This package was changed to choose one of Zenmap's options, 'Intense scan plus UDP' to get effective result data within time shorter than UDP all ports case.
 And this also has an option to run not only IPv4 type but alos IPv6 so it has more options than ver. 1.0.
 
 case 1) IPv4, LAN, TCP all ports
 case 2) IPv4, LAN, UDP all ports
 case 3) IPv4, LAN, Intense scan plus UDP
 case 4) IPv6, LAN, TCP all ports
 case 5) IPv6, LAN, UDP all ports
 case 6) IPv6, LAN, Intense scan plus UDP
 case 7) IPv4, WAN, TCP all ports
 case 8) IPv4, WAN, UDP all ports
 case 9) IPv4, WAN, Intense scan plus UDP
 case 10) IPv6, WAN, TCP all ports
 case 11) IPv6, WAN, UDP all ports
 case 12) IPv6, WAN, Intense scan plus UDP

These cases can be tested using 'LANportscanautomation.bat' and 'WANportscanautomation.bat'. 
Default setting state is to run case 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 so if you want to add to run UDP all ports cases, please remove 'echo' in the command line.

And if you want to know scanning port list of the option, 'Intense scan plus UDP', please refer to a xml file created through nmap command execution.

* Note
. test_portscan.bat, test_autoportscan.bat are deprecated from ver 1.1 package.
. nmapcmdlist.bat, LANportscanautomation.bat and WANportscanautomation.bat are newly included from ver 1.1 package.

[Ver. 1.0]
# Summary
 Zenmap (nmap's GUI version) can create port scanning result as txt, xml but these types are not convenient to read so this package has made to be able to execute port scanning, create result xml, convert it to html and send it by email automatically to provide test engineer's convenience.

# Details
This package can do checking open ports of DUT about 4 cases.

 case 1) LAN, TCP all ports 
 case 2) LAN, UDP all ports
 case 3) WAN, TCP all ports
 case 4) WAN, UDP all ports

To run this package, four type of values should be included like below:
 value 1) DUT info (e.g. t9x, HGJ310, etc.)
 value 2) Communication path, LAN or WAN
 value 3) Protocol type, TCP or UDP
 value 4) Target IP address (e.g. LAN: 192.168.x.x (default gateway), WAN: 221.140.xx.xx (DUT's WAN IP address))
 e.g.) 'test_portscan.bat t9x LAN TCP 192.168.1.1' in test_autoportscan.bat

If you want to execute these commands partially, you should make command lines what you don't want run as comment using 'echo'. 

Information for sending email is located at 'sendmail_html.py'.

. email_sender: an email address of sender
. email_sender_pw: a password of sender's email address
. email_recipients: email addresses for receivers 

e.g.)

email_sender = 'humaxnwXXX@gmail.com'
email_sender_pw = 'humaxpassword'      
email_recipients = ['xxx@xxx.com','ooo@ooo.com']         

You can change these information using your information.
